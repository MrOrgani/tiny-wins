# Contributing to Tiny Wins

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Tiny Wins! This project is built on psychology-first principles, and every contribution helps create technology that genuinely serves human psychological needs.

## üß† Psychology-First Development Principles

Before contributing, please understand our core principles:

### 1. No Shame-Based Language

We never use language that could make someone feel bad about themselves:

- ‚ùå **Avoid**: "failed", "broken", "error", "wrong", "bad", "mistake"
- ‚úÖ **Use instead**: "incomplete", "needs attention", "in progress", "alternative", "opportunity to improve"

### 2. Celebration Over Completion

We emphasize the journey and identity transformation:

- Focus on "showing up" rather than "completion"
- Every success state must include celebration
- Progress is more important than perfection

### 3. Identity Amplification

We consistently reinforce the user's evolving identity:

- "You're becoming someone who..." language patterns
- Present tense affirmations
- Personal transformation vocabulary

### 4. Inclusive and Accessible by Default

Every feature must be accessible to all users:

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum
- Keyboard navigation for all interactions
- Screen reader compatibility
- Touch-friendly design (48px minimum targets)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
- npm 9+
- Git
- VS Code (recommended)

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd tiny-wins

# Setup development environment
npm run setup

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run psychology compliance check
npm run psychology-check
```

### Recommended VS Code Extensions

Our `.vscode/extensions.json` includes recommended extensions. Install them for the best development experience:

- ESLint
- Prettier
- Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
- Accessibility Linter
- GitLens

## üìù Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/encouraging-feature-name
```

Use encouraging, identity-focused branch names:

- ‚úÖ `feature/celebrate-daily-progress`
- ‚úÖ `enhance/identity-reinforcement`
- ‚úÖ `improve/accessibility-navigation`
- ‚ùå `fix/broken-button`
- ‚ùå `bugfix/failed-login`

### 2. Follow Psychology-First Coding Standards

#### Variable and Function Naming

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Psychology-first naming
const celebrateProgress = () => {};
const encouragingMessage = "You're making great progress!";
const isReadyToProgress = checkReadiness();
const showingUpStreak = calculateConsistency();

// ‚ùå Avoid shame-based naming
const handleFailure = () => {};
const errorMessage = 'Something went wrong';
const isBroken = checkStatus();
const failedAttempts = countMistakes();
```

#### Component Development

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Psychology-compliant component
export function ProgressCelebration({ progress }: Props) {
  return (
    <motion.div
      initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
      className="celebrate"
    >
      <h2>You're becoming stronger every day!</h2>
      <Button variant="celebration" size="touch">
        I Showed Up Today!
      </Button>
    </motion.div>
  );
}
```

#### Accessibility Requirements

Every component must include:

```typescript
// Required accessibility features
<Button
  aria-label="Mark reading habit as completed"
  className="touch-friendly"
  onKeyDown={handleKeyboardInteraction}
>
  I Showed Up!
</Button>
```

### 3. Testing Requirements

#### Unit Tests (Psychology-Focused)

```typescript
describe('HabitCard', () => {
  it('uses encouraging language throughout', () => {
    render(<HabitCard habit={mockHabit} />);
    const content = screen.getByRole('article').textContent;
    expect(content).toBeEncouraging();
  });

  it('meets touch target size requirements', () => {
    render(<HabitCard habit={mockHabit} />);
    const button = screen.getByText('I Showed Up!');
    expect(button).toHaveTouchFriendlySize();
  });

  it('supports keyboard navigation', async () => {
    const user = userEvent.setup();
    render(<HabitCard habit={mockHabit} />);

    await user.tab();
    expect(screen.getByText('I Showed Up!')).toHaveFocus();
  });
});
```

#### Required Test Coverage

- **Psychology compliance**: No shame-based language
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, touch targets
- **Performance**: < 200ms interaction response times
- **Motion sensitivity**: Respect for reduced motion preferences

### 4. Quality Checks

Before committing, run:

```bash
npm run validate:quick  # Quick validation
npm run psychology-check  # Psychology compliance
npm run a11y:check  # Accessibility audit
```

Our pre-commit hooks will automatically run these checks, but it's better to catch issues early.

## üé® Design Guidelines

### Color Usage

- **Primary (Sage Green)**: Growth, progress, completion
- **Amber**: "Life happened" understanding (never use red)
- **Charcoal**: Grounded, trustworthy text
- **Warm White**: Fresh starts, clarity

### Typography Hierarchy

```css
.identity-text {
  @apply text-lg font-semibold text-primary;
}

.celebration-text {
  @apply text-base font-medium text-success;
}

.gentle-text {
  @apply text-sm text-muted-foreground;
}
```

### Animation Guidelines

```typescript
// Always respect motion preferences
const shouldAnimate = !window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)')
  .matches;

// Gentle, celebrating animations only
const celebrationVariants = {
  initial: { scale: 1 },
  celebrate: {
    scale: [1, 1.05, 1],
    transition: { duration: 1.5, ease: 'easeOut' },
  },
};
```

## üì± Mobile-First Development

### Responsive Design Principles

1. **Design for 320px first** (iPhone SE)
2. **Touch targets minimum 48px**
3. **Thumb-friendly primary actions**
4. **Safe area inset handling**

### Testing on Mobile

```bash
# Test on various screen sizes
npm run e2e  # Includes mobile device testing
```
